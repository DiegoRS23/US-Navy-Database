# US-Navy-Database
A database (script) for vessels in the US Navy Fleet written in MySQL. Each vessel has its own table that contains the ID and name of the vessel, its captain, coordinates, elevation, years in service, and state(active/inactive). Vessels can also be assigned to a naval fleet and crew members can be assigned to a vessel. Some constraints of this database are only one of each vessel can accompany an aircraft carrier, and you can only assign crew members to aircraft carriers and submarines.
